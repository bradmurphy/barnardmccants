			<div class="quote-1">

				<p>"<em>Barnard focuses on the issues I have with my shoulders and neck and never lets me continue with anything that might put undue strain on those areas.  Working out with Barnard is like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates," I never know what I'm going to get" but I do know it will always be the right thing for me.</em>"</p>

				<p>"<em>The qualities that come to mind when I think about Barnard Mccants are character, integrity, honesty, focus and dedication, this is the type of person I and I would think anyone would want to be associated with.</em>"</p>

				<p>"<em>I would highly recommend Barnard for anyone of any age.  He truly cares about his clients.  He is a true professional and a very nice man who treats everyone with kindness and respect.</em>"</p>

				<p>"<em>I have been working with Barnard for a little over a year. He is truly dedicated to his art in training, but most of all his clients. His style of training can be tailored to any age and fitness level.</em>"</p>

			<div class="quote-5">

				<p>"<em>As a personal trainer myself, I have worked along side Barnard for over a year now. I have worked with many good trainers and I can honestly say Barnard is one of the most knowledgable, kind hearted, humble, and dedicated trainers I have met to date.</em>"</p>

			<div class="quote-6">

				<p>"<em>I have been working out with Barnard for about 6 months. I decided to start with him after watching all the changes he made with my son.  He has not only made my son stronger but also helped him with his posture and self confidence.</em>"</p>

			</div>
			<div class="quote-7">

				<p>"<em>Over the past ten years, I have had five different trainers. With most I knew exactly what exercises I would be doing when I walked in. I would work triceps, biceps, quads, hamstrings and sometimes calves.  The only variations were reps, sets, and amount of weight.  With Barnard the training has been on a multitude of muscles and on proper form.</em>"</p>
