				<p>Welcome to my world of health and fitness. It is a passion that I embrace and enjoy promoting; however my sincere interest is involving and interacting with the youth in our community. Let me share a little about myself before I share my vision of our health in today's environment. </p>

				<p><strong>My name is Barnard McCants and I am a personal trainer, but I prefer to think of myself as a great promoter of "Health!"</strong>  Though fitness has always been a focal point in my life, I would like to acknowledge my Father as a great inspiration to me because of his terrific physical condition. My Father was a boxer and a P/T Assistant instructor in the Army. He embraced my study of Martial Arts in my teenage years and inspired them into my adult years. </p>

				<p>I became diligent in my pursuit of fitness and health due to a very personal situation that dramatically changed my life. While in the Air Force actively pursuing my career I participated heavily in track and boxing. Unfortunately, my military career ended abruptly when I was hit by a drunk driver. I suffered a cracked skull, two broken legs and ended up in a coma for a few days. After months of rehabilitation and physical therapy, I made a very key decision to be intentional about making fitness and well-being a part of my life. This is the message that I wish to inspire in all that I train:</p>

				<span class="about-quote">

					"It is <strong>essential</strong> that all individuals stay physically active throughout their lifetime."

				</span>

				<p>One of my greatest accomplishments was to compete in the Georgia Games in Tae Kwon Do where I received a Bronze Medal. Today I actively compete in power lifting contests (bench press) and soon will be embarking on my first body building show. Through the years my experience has been enhanced by the diversity of professionals that I have had the privilege of training with; it has offered to me a broad scope to share with others.</p>

				<p><strong><span class="about-underline">vision:</span></strong><br /> To inspire today's population to be intentional about incorporating Health into their daily lives.</p>

				<p><strong><span class="about-underline">certifications:</span></strong><br /> ISSA (International Sports Science Association) <br /> Functional Dumbbell Training</p>

		<p>Do not copy what you see in the gym; good chance what you mimic could be wrong.  Seek knowledgeable instruction.</p>
